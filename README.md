**Created by Group 2**

1. Make sure `node`, `npm`, `postgresql` are installed in your computer
1. Run `npm install` in both your client and server directories
1. postgresql `user: postgres`, `password: password`
1. `database: is4302`: `CREATE DATABASE is4302` in your postgresql
1. Ensure Metamask is installed on your browser
1. Run `truffle networks --clean` > `truffle build` > `truffle compile` > `truffle migrate`
1. Ensure Ganache (App) is installed and start your server at `http://localhost:7545` or `http://localhost:8545` if you are using command dev to start your Ganache
1. Change the `7545` to `8545` accordingly if you are using command dev
1. Connect one of your 10x accounts that generated by Ganache to Metamask to test things out
   1. If you are using Ganache (App), import by the private key
1. `cd client` -> `npm start run` to run the frontend, open `http://localhost:3000`
1. `cd server` -> `nodemon server.js` to run the backend (this will drop your is4302 database and resync everytime you run make changes on `server.js`)
1. Make sure your truffle runs on server port 7545, commands such as `compile`, `migrate`, `test` can be used without the keyword `truffle` after running `truffle develop` in your root directory
1. To build the application for production, use `npm run build` in your client directory. Production build will be in the `client/build`folder
1. You can login using `username: admin` and `password: admin`
